# Paperback Cover Generator - Technical Execution Plan

## Overview

This execution plan guides the development of the paperback cover generator web application. The plan is structured in phases, with an initial focus on core UI/UX and AI-assisted design features using placeholders for backend functionalities. Backend systems (database, authentication, payments) will be integrated in later phases.

**Target MVP Features (UI/AI First Approach):**
-   **Core UI & Customization:**
    -   Basic book information input (title, author, page count, trim size, paper type).
    -   Cover image upload and client-side processing/preview.
    -   Interactive spine generation: width calculation, text input, font selection, color, gradient background. **(Basic text rendering and flat color completed)**
    -   Interactive back cover design: flat color, gradient, geometric patterns, text areas (drag, resize, style), option for AI background. **(Basic text rendering and flat color completed)**
    -   OpenAI DALL-E integration for generating/suggesting cover elements (e.g., background patterns, abstract graphics, full back cover backgrounds).
    -   Comprehensive real-time preview system (front, spine, back, full wraparound). **(Partially complete - front, spine, back are previewed with basic styling)**
    -   Client-side PDF/PNG export simulation (final backend export in a later phase).
-   **Placeholders For:**
    -   User authentication (mocked or no auth initially).
    -   Database persistence (local state or browser storage for drafts).
    -   File storage (initial uploads handled client-side or to temporary mock storage).
    -   Credit system and Stripe integration (UI mockups, no live transactions).

**Deliverable:** User can input book details, upload a front cover image, and see a basic, dynamically updating preview of the front, spine, and back.

## Phase 3: Spine and Back Cover Customization UI

### 3.1 Spine Customization Interface
**AI Task:** Develop UI controls for spine:
-   Text input for spine title, author. **(Completed)**

### 5.2 Client-Side Export Simulation
**AI Task:** file generation:
-   "Export to PNG" button: Convert current canvas state to a PNG image and trigger download in browser. **Completed. Output is simulated at 300 DPI by upscaling canvas draw operations.**
-   "Export to PDF" button: Explore client-side PDF generation libraries (e.g., `jsPDF`) to create a basic PDF from the canvas. Output will be for preview/simulation, not print-ready quality yet. **Completed using jsPDF. Output is simulated at 300 DPI by upscaling canvas draw operations before adding to PDF. Final print-quality backend generation deferred as planned.**

-   **Input Validation Improvements:** Fixed input field clamping during typing by moving validation from onChange to onBlur for smooth user experience. **Completed**

**Deliverable:** Complete font consistency between preview and export, stable OAuth configuration across all deployment types, advanced text formatting with full alignment support, and improved input validation for seamless user experience.**

**STATUS: POST-LAUNCH ENHANCEMENTS COMPLETE. Font rendering system ensures identical preview and export output. OAuth system handles all Vercel deployment scenarios gracefully. Text formatting system provides professional typography options with proper line break handling.**

## Recent Enhancements and Bug Fixes (January 2025)

### Auto-Sizing Blurb Box System
**Completed:**
-   **Intelligent Text Measurement:** Implemented text measurement system that calculates required dimensions based on font size, line height, and text content. **Completed**
-   **Auto-Sizing Logic:** Blurb boxes automatically adjust height based on text content while maintaining user-defined width and padding settings. **Completed**
-   **Balanced Layout:** Auto-sizing takes into account padding, line height, and font metrics to create properly spaced text layouts. **Completed**
-   **Barcode Protection:** Auto-sizing respects barcode area constraints and adjusts positioning automatically to prevent overlap. **Completed**
-   **UI Simplification:** Removed manual height controls from BackCoverControls since height is now automatically determined by text content. **Completed**

### File Upload System Enhancements
**Completed:**
-   **Large File Support:** Implemented dual upload system with Vercel Blob direct uploads for files up to 10MB and compressed fallback for smaller files. **Completed**
-   **Upload Limit Bypass:** Resolved Vercel's 4.5MB serverless function limit by implementing direct client-to-blob uploads that bypass the API routes entirely. **Completed**
-   **Smart Compression:** Enhanced image compression algorithm with iterative quality reduction to fit within fallback limits while maintaining visual quality. **Completed**
-   **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with specific guidance for 413 errors, timeouts, and large file issues. **Completed**

### OAuth and Authentication Stability
**Completed:**
-   **Build Error Resolution:** Fixed ESLint errors with unescaped entities and missing React dependencies that prevented production builds. **Completed**
-   **OAuth Debug Enhancement:** Improved preview deployment detection to only disable OAuth on explicit preview environments, not production deployments accessed via deployment URLs. **Completed**
-   **Error Response Handling:** Enhanced OAuth error handling to provide clearer debugging information and prevent "error: undefined" messages. **Completed**
-   **Production Deployment:** Verified OAuth functionality works correctly on stable production domain with proper redirect URI configuration. **Completed**

### Technical Infrastructure Improvements
**Completed:**
-   **Vercel Blob Integration:** Full implementation of direct client-to-blob uploads with proper authentication, file validation, and metadata tracking. **Completed**
-   **Database Metadata Tracking:** Enhanced file metadata storage system that works with both direct uploads and fallback compression. **Completed**
-   **TypeScript Safety:** Resolved callback signature mismatches and improved type safety across upload system components. **Completed**
-   **Canvas Image Loading:** Fixed Image constructor issues in compression pipeline by using globalThis.Image() for better browser compatibility. **Completed**

**Deliverable:** Robust file upload system supporting files up to 10MB, intelligent auto-sizing blurb boxes that adapt to content, and stable OAuth authentication across all deployment scenarios. Users can now upload large cover images without compression quality loss and blurb text automatically sizes for optimal layout.**
